Virus epidemy simulations 
A very simple (and humble) attempt to create a simulation tool to play with and discover the effect of various parameters on the spreading of a certain virus (you know).

The technology should be as simple as possible. Use browser for visualization, assume a modern one (no intent to cover ancient versions or IE). Use HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 (maybe discover cute features).

Hod should it work?
Set a number of parameters on a form, then start the simulation, which produces daily data, and then visualize the data on a chart (or several charts), extract key indicators, maybe export the data in csv or JSON format.
